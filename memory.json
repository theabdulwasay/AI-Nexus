Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947 and then as Pakistan's first governor-general until his death a year later in 1948. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.

In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated for Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.\n- Muhammad Ali Jinnah Category\n- Jinnah family\n- Sindh Madressatul Islam University alumni\n- Pakistani newspaper founders\n- Church Mission School alumni",

Included broadly in the sciences, computer science spans theoretical disciplines to applied disciplines. An expert in the field is known as a computer scientist. Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science. The theory of computation concerns abstract models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and preventing security vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing software.\n- Computer science Category\n- Computer science education - Computer science education or computing education is the field of teaching and learning the discipline of computer science, and computational thinking.\n- Glossary of computer science - This glossary of computer science is a list of definitions of terms and concepts used in computer science, its sub-disciplines, and related fields, including terms relevant to software, data science, and computer programming.\n- Outline of computer science - Computer science is the study of the theoretical foundations of information and computation and their implementation and application in computer systems.\n- Formal sciences",
